## Spektro

Spektro is a lightweight, responsive and modern CSS framework based on the awsome project <a href="https://picturepan2.github.io/spectre">Spectre.css
 </a>

## Rationale
Seeing that Spectre.css seemed abandoned, we decided to create our own maintained fork of it to push the project further.
Therefore if you had pull requests that weren't merged on spectre we will be happy to review them and merge them.

## Features
- Lightweight (~10KB gzipped) starting point for your projects
- Flexbox-based, responsive and mobile-friendly layout
- Elegantly designed and developed elements and components

Spektro is a side project based on the years of CSS development work on a large web service project. Spektro only includes modern base styles, responsive layout system, CSS components and utilities, and it can be modified for your project with Sass/Scss compiler.

Spektro is completely free to use.

## Browser support
Spektro uses [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) to make most styles compatible with earlier browsers and [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) for CSS resets. spektro is designed for modern browsers. For best compatibility, these browsers are recommended:

- Chrome (LAST 4)
- Microsoft Edge (LAST 4)
- Firefox (EXTENDED SUPPORT RELEASE)
- Safari (LAST 4)
- Opera (LAST 4)
- Internet Explorer 10+

Spektro supports Internet Explorer 10+, but some HTML5 and CSS3 features are not perfectly supported by Internet Explorer.
